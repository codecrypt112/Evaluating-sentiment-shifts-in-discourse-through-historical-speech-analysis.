1960,"Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country. Revolution is a struggle to the death between the future and the past. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. The future belongs to those who prepare for it today. We are going to build a democratic society in Singapore, based on justice and equality. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan. The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall."
1970,"India stands by Bangladesh in their fight for liberation. We will wage a thousand-year war. Where there is discord, may we bring harmony."
1980,"India is an old country, but a young nation. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! Democracy is the best revenge."
1990,"Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another. India is now a nuclear power — not to threaten others but to protect itself."
2000,"I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you, and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action. Entrepreneurship is all about passion, perseverance, and patience. This strategic partnership will be a milestone in Indo-US relations. Change has come to America."
2010,"One child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world. Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia. This victory is the victory of the people. We can manage this. We can do it. Canada is back. Brexit means Brexit, and we are going to make a success of it. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. The world is watching us. Europe and the world are waiting for us to defend the spirit of Enlightenment. Pakistan will rise when justice prevails. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood."
2020,"We are going to go hard, and we are going to go early. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue. We will fight for our land, we will fight for our freedom. We must remain committed to socialism with Chinese characteristics."
